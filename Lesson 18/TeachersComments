Well done!

3. -0.5
No need in the subquery. Count() can be used in the order by.

4. -0.5
Why do we need group by?

5. -1
Can be solved in one query.
Also, HAVING condition should be in the WHERE.
Table Department is useless.

You said that HW17 would also be done. I don't see it.

Test notes:
KPI font is not the same.
Count of movies - null values is not filtered out.
What is a better filter for last 25 years: create a filter by release_date (not release date year), select relative date filtering and then type "in the last 25 years".
Bottom left table - I don't want to see a scroll option. You could make first column smaller.
Also, it was mentioned that it needed to be one page with 2 views.
